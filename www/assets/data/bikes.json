      "notes":"I discovered Bikepacking and got into riding trail in the Dublin hills. I discovered goat heads and hated it int he beginning. The Crank was creaky since day 1 but got used to the different kind of rinding. I used it for everything: groceries, technical uphill in the Pleasanton ridge, long road excursions in Marin and quick rides back in Berkeley. Until I got it stolen.",

      "notes":"I explored Berkeley and the bay on this one. Did a lot of grocery shopping. Learned to change a tire and fix thing on the bike. The chain broke once because of leaning it against other bike in the Train. This things was fast, I loved most of the time I spent on it. It was my first real bike with all the good that comes with a first experience. I got close to crashing a few times but never had major incidents.",
