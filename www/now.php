            My first priority is to slow down - quite literally. Generally doing less and enjoying more. I'm a monkey with a tech job and a growing family. I care a lot about very few things (a recent realization). That means commitment to just a few people, interests, and projects. That makes life feel simple(r) and sincere.

            These days most of my productive design time goes to GitHub. The rest of my limited availability is occasionally invested in shorter (cherry picked) engagements. If my stuff resonates with you and you have ideas, feel free to send me an email.

            I don't do Design Therapy anymore. It's been therapeutic and I made some lovely connections. I still doodle for this site and have a fixation/meditation. When I make something decent, I sometimes post it <a href="https://folio.procreate.com/slrncl">Here</a>.

            I've been struggling with becoming a dad. Fatigue is getting the best of me and I can't put on any weight or really pay my sleep debt at the moment. This transition is pushing me to acknowledge the "qualitative" aspect of life. At the heart of all the books, anecdotes or conversation on the matter, the good life seems to be a sort of dynamic contemplation with moments of deep appreciation.

            I have a complicated relationship with this website. I've been redesigning it too often but love to tinker on it. So far I'm denying myself the right to have a blog. I have my <a href="index.php#footnotes">footnotes</a> if I want to blab. It's on my homepage and some of the stuff in there is really personal and silly.

          <h2 class="text-color-primary large-margin-top">Growing a beard</h2>
          <p class="medium-margin-top text-regular text-color-secondary">
            Facial hair has been a recurring proxy for my frustration around pragmatism and the desire for ultimate closure. It would be really nice if rationality could clearly outline every decision and cycle for us. But that’s not how life seems to work. So I grow my beard. To a point where my wife nags me about it. A point where it periodically feels slightly uncomfortable physically and socially. I don’t do that as some kind of punishment but; rather, to increase my enjoyment of life. I will shave, I don’t know when nor why. The cycle will begin again. Like many other things in life there isn’t much satisfying closure, no “endgame”, no perfectly rational decision. Just cycles of change.
