            My first priotity is to slow down - quite literaly. Generally doing less and enjoying more. I'm a monkey with a tech job and a growing family. I care a lot about very few things (a recent realization). That means commitment to just a few people, interests, and projects. That makes life feel simple(r) and sincere.

            These days most of my productive design time goes to GitHub. The rest of my limited availability is occasinally invested in shorter (cheery picked) engagements . If my stuff resonate with you and you have ideas, feel free to send me an email.

            I don't do Design Therapy anymore. I'ts been therapeutic and I made some lovely connections. I still doodle for this site and has a fixation/meditation. When I make something decent, I sometimes post it <a href="https://folio.procreate.com/slrncl">Here</a>.

            I have a complicated relationship with this website. I've been redesigning it too often but love to tinker on it. So far I'm denying myself the right to have a blog. I have my <a href="index.php#footnotes">footnotes</a> if I want to blab. It's on my homepage and some of the stuff in there is really personal and silly.
